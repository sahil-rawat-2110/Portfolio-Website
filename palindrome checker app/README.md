Project Folder Structure:

Before we start coding we take a look at the project folder structure. We start by creating a folder called – ”Is it a palindrome?”. Inside this folder, we have 3 files. These files are – ‘index.html’, style.css, and script.js.




----------------HTML----------------

We begin with the HTML code.


----------------CSS----------------

Next, we style our game using CSS.


----------------Javascript----------------

Finally, we add functionality using Javascript. 

We begin by creating initial references. When the user clicks submit we first check if the input is empty. We stop the code if the input is empty else, we remove any non-alphanumeric characters from the word and also convert all the letters to lowercase. Further, we reverse the word by splitting it into an array, reversing the array, and joining the letters back. If the reversed word and current word are the same we display that the given word is a Palindrome else, not a palindrome. Finally, we add classes to our message to match the color based on the message.
