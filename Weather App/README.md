Project Folder Structure:

Before we begin the actual coding, let us first take a look at the project folder structure. We create a project folder called – “Weather App”. Within this app, we have 4 files. These files are index.html which is the HTML document. Next, we have style.css which is the stylesheet. Finally, we have key.js and script.js which are both script files.




HTML:
We start with HTML. 


CSS:
Next, we style our app using CSS. 


Javascript:
We now sign up at Open Weather API. And copy-paste the API key in our key.js file as a global variable.

Finally, we add functionality to the code using Javascript.
